<b>as of February 2024, this app is no longer functional. 

Crytek has patched Hunt Showdown such that hunter data is no longer stored locally. Ergo, this app will no longer track your hunts.

So long, and thanks for all the fish</b>

This program was made to record hunt statistics in the game <b>Hunt: Showdown</b>.
<br>It works by tracking changes in the attributes.xml file, which is updated after every Hunt, and recording them in a local sqlite database.
<p>
Data for the beetle spawn locations in the maps is from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2876319397">RinLove's Steam Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
App has to be running for hunts to be logged.
</p>

When running the app for the first time, click on Settings, Select Hunt Install Directory, and choose your Hunt install directory ( something like C:/Steam/steamapps/common/Hunt Showdown ) .
Then click Change Steam Name, enter your Steam username and press Enter.

# How to run

Currently I recommend running it directly as a Python script, as the executable is getting incorrectly flagged as a virus by Windows.

Otherwise, you can try downloading the latest version from the <a href="https://github.com/majikat768/HuntStatsLogger/releases">Releases</a>. You may need to add an exception in Windows Defender.

#

## To run script directly:

### You'll need to have Python3 and pip installed. Get Python3 <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">here</a>. Pip should be included.

<p>To verify they're installed, open a cmd prompt or PowerShell, and execute `python --version; pip --version` which will output the version you have installed.</p>

open a PowerShell or cmd prompt, navigate to the git directory, and execute:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt;  python ./src/main.py
```

Alternatively, right click on <b>startapp.ps1</b> and choose <b>Run with PowerShell</b>, which will automatically execute the above command.

( I'm not associated with Crytek or Hunt Showdown in any way. This program is free and open source software. )
